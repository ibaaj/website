# About

I have been a Ph.D student in Artificial Intelligence with the CEA (French Center for Atomic and alternative Energies) and Sorbonne University under the supervision of JP Poli, N Maudet and W Ouerdane since november 2018.

my subject is : *the textual justification generation for a fuzzy expert system*, involving topics such as explainable artificial intelligence, fuzzy inference and natural language generation.

I studied before mathematics applied to cryptology at Paris 7 Diderot University and artificial intelligence at Paris 5 Descartes University.
