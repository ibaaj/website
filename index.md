## About

I am a freshly-minted PhD in Artificial Intelligence. I defended my PhD thesis entilted "Explainaibility of possibilistic and fuzzy rule-based system" (eXplainable Artificial Intelligence, Knowledge Representation and Reasoning, Uncertainty modeling): on January 27th, 2022 at Sorbonne University. This work has led to the following publications (with oral presentation):
