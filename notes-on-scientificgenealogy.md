It took me several months to find my scientific genealogy. You should know that this hierarchy does not really exist before the end of the 19th century. 
Here are some useful resources to find your scientific genealogy:
- https://academictree.org/
- https://mathgenealogy.org/ (90% of my tree comes from this site)
- theses.fr
- idref 
- Worldcat
- Biblioth√®que National de France (BNF): I had to contact the BNF to get a scan of the first pages of a thesis
- Borrowing dissertations from university libraries
- HAL open archives
